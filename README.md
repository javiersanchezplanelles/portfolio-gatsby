  Portfolio
</h1>

<p>I revamped my portfolio using ReactJS and GatsbyJS. The reason I chose these technologies is because I like their approach: React's reusable components and Gatsby's easily generated sites make for a great combination and a great learning experience.</p>
<p>I also installed two JavaScript libraries: particles.js and typed.js, so that I could add some cool animations.</p>

<ul>Improved skills:
  <li>ReactJS: creating stateful components and passing state from parents to children as props.</li>
  <li>GasbyJS: building the site according to Gatsby conventions and use some of its librarys for add-on functionality.</li>
</ul>
